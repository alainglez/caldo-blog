## How was the website created?

A weekend project, this website was constructed using Hugo "The world's fastest framework for building websites". Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. It is written in go language and thus super fast, <1 milisecond per page, building your site in miliseconds. It is based on the powerful, light and extensible go html & text templates, supports markdown and shortcodes, comes with templates for SEO, commenting and analytics, plus it is polyglot. I chose a material-design, responsive theme from pdevty.

It is fun! Check out Hugo at:

The code for the Hugo project is hosted on GitHub and, to boot, the actual website is hosted for free by Github Pages convenient service at:

To finish the hosting configuration, I created an A resource with Google Domains for my custom domain http://caldo.io and linked it to the GitHub Pages website.

Next step is to be add a nice user interface using Reactjs library.

I will keep you posted :-)
