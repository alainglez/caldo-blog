## How was the website created?

A weekend project, this website was constructed using Hugo "The world's fastest framework for building websites". Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. It is written in go language and thus super fast, <1 milisecond per page, building your site in miliseconds. It is based on the powerful, light and extensible go html & text templates, supports markdown and shortcodes, comes with templates for SEO, commenting and analytics, plus it is polyglot. I chose a material-design, responsive theme from pdevty.

It is fun! Check out Hugo @

The code for the site's Hugo project is hosted on github and, to boot, it is hosted for free by Github pages convenient service @

To finish the hosting configuration, I'm going to set up my custom domain caldo.io.

Next step is going to be adding some nice user interface to make it a web application using Reactjs library.

I will keep you posted :-)
