##### Enterprise Digital Transformations are complex business.

Today's Enterprise eCommerce Sites are complex, mission-critical systems. To understand where complexity comes from, here are some of the questions that need to be answered continuously for the code written and shipped incrementally by a modern software development team.

1.  Does it work?
2.  Is it performant?
3.  Is it secure?
4.  Is it available?
5.  Is it reliable?
6.  Is it scalable?
7.  Is it resilient?
8.  Is it responsive design?
9.  Is it ADA compliant?
10. Is it maintainable?
11. Is it observable?
12. Is it traceable?
13. Is it monitored?
14. Is there low-noise automated alerting?
15. Is it manually tested?

32. Is it A/B tested?
33. Is it deployed via a canary?
34. Is it easy to rollback?
35. Is it using the best technology stack?
36. Is the infrastructure working (Metal Servers, VMs, Containers, Network, Load Balancer, Operating System, Web Server)
37. Are the subsystems working? (CMS, Mainframe, OLTP Database, Data Streams, Data Warehouse, Caching - Elastic/Redis)
38. Is the content delivery network working?
39. Is the internet working? (DNS, ISP)
40. Are the resources qualified?
41. Are the resources well-paid?

48. Are the computers adequate for the job?
49. Is the office layout and furniture conducive to productivity or distractions?
50. Is there a collaborative working environment?
51. Is there a culture that supports innovation and learning from failure?
52. Is there a real partnership between Business, Development, Security and Operations teams?
53. Is the conversion rate for every page of your booking funnel normal all the time? This is the question that really matters to the business but, since the goal is to continually improve the conversion rate over time, it is a moving target!


While far from exhaustive, these questions show how complex these systems are and how many things need to be in place. That is why we need CALDO, a mix of Cloud, Agile, Lean and DevOps to undertake a digital transformation and have the operation running smoothly.
