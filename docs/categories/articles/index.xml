      <description>How was the website created? A weekend project, this website was constructed using Hugo &amp;ldquo;The world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites&amp;rdquo;. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. It is written in go language and thus super fast, &amp;lt;1 milisecond per page, building your site in miliseconds. It is based on the powerful, light and extensible go html &amp;amp; text templates, supports markdown and shortcodes, comes with templates for SEO, commenting and analytics, plus it is polyglot.</description>
