      <description>Thoughts on Lean Lean is IT. Lean really started it all, not only it revolutionized the Toyota manufacturing process and made it the standard, but provided the scientific underpinning for the Agile methodologies &amp;ndash; saving us from decades of Waterfall process &amp;ndash; and the DevOps transformation of the last few years. I have participated in both Agile and DevOps transformations as a change agent, but 2017 is the year of Lean for enterprise IS management.</description>

      <description>What is caldo? In spanish, caldo means sauce. CALDO is also an abbreviation for Cloud, Agile, Lean and DevOps.
To me: caldo is the sauce for today&amp;rsquo;s enterprise IS management.
This is a professional blog to share my perspective and experience in management of enterprise application development teams.
I actually do this for a living at carnival.com.
Hope you enjoy the reading and find it helpful.
