      <description>Thoughts on Lean Lean is IT. Lean really started it all, not only it revolutionized the Toyota manufacturing process and made it the standard, but provided the scientific underpinning for the Agile methodologies &amp;ndash; saving us from decades of Waterfall process &amp;ndash; and the DevOps transformation of the last few years.

      <description>How was the website created? A weekend project, this website was constructed using Hugo &amp;ldquo;The world&amp;rsquo;s fastest framework for building websites&amp;rdquo;. Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. It is written in go language and thus super fast, &amp;lt;1 milisecond per page, building your site in miliseconds. It is based on the powerful, light and extensible go html &amp;amp; text templates, supports markdown and shortcodes, comes with templates for SEO, commenting and analytics, plus it is polyglot.</description>

      <description>What is caldo? In spanish, caldo means sauce. CALDO is also an abbreviation for Cloud, Agile, Lean and DevOps.
To me: caldo is the sauce for today&amp;rsquo;s enterprise IS management.
This is a professional blog to share my perspective and experience in management of enterprise applications development teams.
I actually do this for a living at carnival.com.
Hope you enjoy the reading and find it helpful.</description>
